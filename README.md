# ATM-Machine
This Project is to make an Automated Teller Machine.
The progrm is written in simple python language 
In this we have firstly
-->taken Input of 4 digit user pin for authentication
-->have to input user pin double times and check
whether they are equal.
-->If pin is found okay, ask for the input selection of
numbers from 1 to 4.
1. Check saving balance and print the
balance.
2. Deposit funds from the user and
print the saving balance after deposit.
3. Withdraw funds from the savings
balance account and print the balance after
withdrawal
4. Transfer funds from checking
balance to savings balance.For this, you have to
initially create the variable for checking balance
and assign some amount to that variable. If
selection 4 is made, the amount from checking
balance must be debited and credited to saving
account. Then, you have to print the balance in
checking balance and saving balance.
--> If selection is other than 1 to 4, print invalid choice
and exit the loop.
